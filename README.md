# HexQuest

## 📘 Project Overview

HexQuest is an educational Unity-based project developed as a 2D game prototype to demonstrate fundamental concepts of software engineering and game development.

The project focuses on the implementation of graph-based pathfinding algorithms, a strict modular architecture, and a clear separation between core game logic and visual presentation.  
A custom level editor was developed, along with map serialization and persistence using ScriptableObjects, enabling reusable and data-driven game content.

During development, ChatGPT 5.2 was actively used as a development assistant for architectural discussions, code review, and problem-solving.  
In addition, AI-generated artwork created with GPT-based tools was integrated into the project as visual assets.

Project planning and task tracking were conducted using Trello, and the complete source code is maintained on GitHub as part of the project portfolio.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The gameplay is centered around navigating a hero character across a sector-based map.  
The player must guide the hero from a starting sector (A) to a target sector (B) while avoiding enemy encounters.

- Victory condition: reaching the designated target sector  
- Defeat condition: depletion of the hero’s health points (HP)
